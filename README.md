## Objective

The main objective of this project is to perform an in-depth Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the provided dataset. The EDA process involves a comprehensive analysis of the data to draw insights, recognize patterns, and detect trends in internet costs across the globe. The analysis will facilitate the understanding of relationships between different variables and grant valuable insights into the divergence of internet expenses among various countries. Visualizations, summary statistics, and diverse data exploration techniques will be employed to extract significant knowledge from the dataset.

Furthermore, the historical evolution of internet access in India, along with its integration into the populace, adds context to the global analysis. This context could potentially enrich the interpretation of the observed global trends within the dataset.

Feel free to explore the dataset, analyze the findings, and contribute to our understanding of internet prices and accessibility worldwide.
